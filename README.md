This repo contains a version-controlled fork of the `examples.utf` file that is published weekly
on the [FTP server at edrdg.org](https://www.edrdg.org/wiki/index.php/Sentence-Dictionary_Linking).

I am adding commits to this repo to mirror the individual edits that I make to the canonical database
hosted on tatoeba.org. Therefore the `examples.utf` file in this repo will not always
perfectly mirror the corresponding file on the EDRDG FTP server. However, I am synchronizing this
file with the EDRDG version every time a new update is available.
